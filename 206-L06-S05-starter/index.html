          <h2>About me!</h2>
          <p><strong>Hi, I'm Tammala Martin.</strong> a dedicated professional with over 23 years of experience in the real estate industry. 
            At 41 years old, I've recently embarked on an exhilarating new journey into coding, marking a significant career shift driven by 
            my passion for technology and continuous learning. </p>

            consistently delivering outstanding results. My ability to adapt to evolving market trends and my strong work ethic have been instrumental
             in my success. </p>
            
            <p> My decision to delve into coding reflects my eagerness to explore new horizons and acquire new skills. It's a natural extension of my 
             analytical mindset and creativity, showcasing my commitment to personal and professional growth. </p>
            
            <p>Beyond my professional endeavors, I cherish my role as a devoted wife and mother of two, seamlessly balancing my career aspirations with 
              my family responsibilities. I'm known for my resilience and proactive approach to life, inspiring others through my courage to reinvent 
              myself and pursue my passions.</p>
